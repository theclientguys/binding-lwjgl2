# binding-lwjgl2

This is an implementation of the **binding** library designed to work with LWJGL2-based versions of Minecraft (up until version 1.13). The `LWJGLKey` and `LWJGLButton` classes serve as the implementation of keyboard keys and mouse buttons in this system, and should be used to parameterize the *binding* classes accordingly.
